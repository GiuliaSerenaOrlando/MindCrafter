Son of hell betrayer of light\
king of the dark your name is carved on my steel\
for your will the innocent die every day\
but my sword will soon come for you all\
and your kingdom will fall\
and you'll be dust again forever\
\
brave all we'll march\
to give you the eternal agony\
\
Love magic word fill all my dreams eternally use me\
Love guide me to ecstasy to victory to infinity\
to rhymes of winds to the voice of the dead\
to innocence of my memory\
\
Rape of earth I want your head\
sadist pig I can't forgive what you did\
all the blood you're sucking out of my land\
But my sword will soon come for you all\
and your kingdom will fall\
and you'll be dust again forever\
\
brave all we'll march\
to give you the eternal agony\
\
"Go, mighty warrior... The kings of enchanted lands are awaiting your\
victory! Ride on the wings of wisdom, ride beyond the middle valleys to\
defeat the master of chaos in the name of cosmic justice. Peace and love\
forever!"}
